## Use License
I recommend you change the logo and the items and links in the navbar to fit your page functions.
For example you can change one item to "SignUp", or "LogIn", or "Pricing", or "ContactUs", etc. For better experience don't put two words in one item.
You can change the text and the link in the button too.
## Image
I made the image myself. It's free to use too.
